# JIP Editor Guide

## Background

This guide attempts to help prospective and actual JIP editors understand the process. It is a distillation of the [JIP standard](../jip-1/jip.md) from their point of view. It may also be useful to read the guides offered to [council members](council_member_guide.md), [domain authorities](domain_authority_guide.md) and [editors](editor_guide.md)

## Who are you as the editor?

The most important high level guiding principle any effective editor must keep in mind is to understand their role properly. The role of the editor is as part cheerleader part umpire, trying to make good faith JIP authors and owners as successful as they can be in developing, promulgating and gaining adoption for their standards. This means helping them make themselves properly understood, getting robust feedback and following the rules of the game.

## Who does what?

The JIP standard does not try to make detailed recommendations about how editors coordinate amongst each other, but it is advisable that editors are proactive in autonomously finding their own means of making sure everyone is on the same page about who is responsible for what proposal. This will help avoid misunderstandings that risk leaving other stakeholders frustrated and disappointed.

## Guide

1. A good place to keep an eye on is the pre review JIP discussion category, as newcomers post JIPs at the idea stage. While the JIP process does not describe anything very specific when it comes to how exactly editors communicate with each other or with authors, however taking a proactive approach and being available is generally advisable. Importantly, keep up to date and accurate contact information on your membership which allows new authors to contact you directly.
2. When a JIP enters `Draft` stage, and both you, your peer editors and the author should have aligned expectations around your role w.r.t that proposal. Your primary role at this stage is to make sure the document complies with the constraints of the process, and in particular that the domains listed as part of the proposal are appropriate for that proposal, if it is a council proposal. For council proposals its very important to give the owners an early indication about whether the standard is likely to pass or not, to conserve effort, and looping in the right domain authorities promptly is advisable to this end.
3. The most important milestone in the life of any proposal is when it formally enters the `Review` stage, as this is when the public conversation can properly begin, and there is a fully specified proposal at hand. From this point on, merge owner revisions, and make sure you announce each merged change to the discussion thread. You must decide, in collaboration with the owners, whether this is a long lived standard that will need to be augmented indefinitely, or whether it should stop being edited after an initial review process. The former should be a proposal that ends up in the `Living` stage, while the latter progresses either for enactment or to `Final` stage, depending on whether it is a council or community proposal, respectively.
4. Any stage transition, or change in ownership, must be published to the discussion thread as well, in a standard format, and any proposals must be logged to the `proposals` header as well.
