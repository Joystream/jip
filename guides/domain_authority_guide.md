# JIP Domain Authority Guide

## Background

This guide attempts to help prospective and actual JIP domain authorities understand the process. It is a distillation of the [JIP standard](../jip-1/jip.md) from their point of view. It may also be useful to read the guides offered to [council members](council_member_guide.md), [authors and owners](author_owner_guide.md) and [editors](editor_guide.md)
