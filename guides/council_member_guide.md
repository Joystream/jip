# JIP Council Member Guide

## Background

This guide attempts to help prospective and actual council members understand the JIP process. It is a distillation of the [JIP standard](../jip-1/jip.md) from their point of view. It may also be useful to read the guides offered to [authors and owners](author_owner_guide.md), [domain authorities](domain_authority_guide.md) and [editors](editor_guide.md)

## Guide

The council has three responsibilities in the JIP process.

1. Manage the overall integrity of the process through the JIP process parameter update proposal, where they signal key root of trust indicators and actors for the process. They must also possibly fund the involvement of key actors who must devote time and resources to the process, such as domain authorities and editors.
2. Sign off on key stage transitions in the life-cycle of proposals. They should largely be verifying that the editors and authorities have followed the steps involved in the proposal for that stage transition, and that other appropriate third parties have signed off if required, such as owners or domain authorities.
3. Enacting council proposals. This is their most important role, as enacting certain change has implications for how the networks operates in a way that may not be backwards compatible and which others cannot opt out of. Evaluating such enactments must be done informed by the judgement of domain authorities, but not bound by them. Ultimately the council is solving for whatever strategic objectives currently are important for the DAO, hence enacting a council proposal is ultimately a decision which takes into account a broad range of considerations.

NB: this Guide probably needs to be expanded in the future, this is it for now, due to time constraints.
