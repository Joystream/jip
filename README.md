# Joystream Improvement Proposals (JIPs)

>  A social process for improving Joystream.

A process for how to propose and enact new standards for the Joystream Network and surrounding ecosystem, with an emphasis on transparency, verifiability, formality and clarity, by using the  governance, identity and publishing capabilities of the Joystream blockchain.

For specific questions and concerns regarding JIPs, it's best to comment on the relevant discussion thread of the JIP denoted by the `forum-thread` header in the JIP's preamble.
